# Daily Smarty Search Engine

The Daily Smarty Search Engine, served up on Heroku, returns Daily Smarty posts matching the search terms. Built with ReactJS, NodeJS, and SCSS the journey begins with a user entering search terms. The app then reaches out to the Daily Smarty api using NodeJS to retrieve posts matching the search terms. The returned posts are then rendered to a results page for the user's informational delight.
